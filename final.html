              After considering different projects in which we could 
work, such as braille instant reader, a device to help people with 
Parkinson and many other, we have decided that we wanted to work with a 
little child who doesn’t have the left arm.
            </p>
        <p></p>
         
            <h2><font color="#a19a59"><big> Getting involved with the project: </big></font></h2>
         
        <p></p>
            <p >
                At the moment, the girl has an orthosis that was created
 by Lars Thalmann, person whose project we will try to improve, in order
 to suit better to the girl. In order to work in a more productive way, 
we have concerted a meeting with Lars on January 11.
            </p>
         <p></p>
             <p >
                The orthosis the girl is wearing, covers a lot of 
functions that made her life much easier, and she has adapted to make it
 suit all the different environments she faces, but we thought that 
maybe we could work on it and try to better the arm.
            </p>

        <p></p>
                <font size="5," color="#a19a59"><b> Description of the current orthosis: </b></font>
         <p></p>
            <p >
                First of all,  we are going to describe the orthosis she
 wears right now. This orthosis is fixed by four different straps to her
 left arm. There are two straps right down the shoulder, and two 
different straps at the top of the elbow. These straps can be adapted 
thanks to the use of Velcro.
            </p>
                
        <p></p>
            <p >
                When describing the arm-like part of the orthosis, we 
can clearly define two different areas. The one which is down the elbow,
 which is simulating an arm and a hand, and the upper part, which is the
 one that lets the arm part rise.
            </p>

                <h2><font color="#a19a59"><big> Developing our own ideas: </big></font></h2>
         
        <p></p>
            <p >
                Since this will be a customized orthosis, it is 
important that we take exact measures of the girl. We would need to 
measure the length of the forearm and arm, the diameter and all the 
different physical magnitudes. Afterwards, we would have to use the 3D 
scanner as we did in class, and make a good scanner of the arm and 
forearm.
            </p>

        <p></p>
            <p >
                Once we had that, we would start to work with the other 
variables. When doing the project, we must consider three different 
fields of work: the mechanical part, the electronic part and the design 
part.
            </p>

        <p></p>
                <font size="5," color="#a19a59"><b> Lets start talking about the design part: </b></font>
         <p></p>
            <p >
                One of the things that we know, is that the mother wants
 to have a textile that covers the forearm. When thinking what the most 
appropriate textile would be to put there, we thought that it should be 
an elastic piece of fabric, since the biceps and triceps are muscles 
that suffer a big conformational change when contracting and relaxing. 
Then, we thought that it could also be nice to make the textile 
waterproof. After doing some research, we found that <b> solid laminated polyurethane </b>
 would be the textile that can cover the requisites. In order to not 
interfere with the different straps that are used to be able to wear the
 orthosis, we thought that we could use some Velcro at the part that 
would be in the internal forearm (part facing the torso).
            </p>
         <p></p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we though that the straps could made more 
comfortable. In order to reduce the pressure that they make in the 
girl´s arm, we thought that we could add some padding into them.
            </p>
         <p></p>

                <font size="5," color="#a19a59"><b> Now lets talk about the mechanical part: </b></font>
         <p></p>
            <p >
                In order to do this part properly, we have to consider 
how our orthosis is going to be like, and if we keep the actual design 
or try to make a new one. 
                We made a model of a hand, that needs to be smoothened, 
but we think it could work for the girl.
            </p>
         <p></p>
                <img src="final_files/1.PNG">
         <p></p>
         
            <p >
                What we want to make is the arm to be able to go up and 
down, when the girl needs it, and the hand to be able to close and catch
 different objects.
            </p>
         <p></p>
            <p >
                In order to make the arm go up and down, since she has a
 little part of arm, these actions can be made mechanically by her. It 
would be interesting to introduce some kind of mechanism such as pulleys
 that would let her do the activities without having to make much effort
 with the biceps.
            </p>
         <p></p>
         
            <p >
                As mentioned above, we wanted to make the girl be able 
to grab things with the hand, by making the orthosis responsive to the 
movements the girl makes. After doing some research, we found that with 
the use of <i> electrodes, amplifiers and a 4,8V accumulator (6 V for adults) </i>
 , some new prosthetics and orthosis use measure the difference in 
electric current when the muscles open the Ca2+ channels, in order to 
contract. These are called <b> myoelectric orthosis </b>, and is 
something we would like to work with to try to make the hand close when 
she contracts the muscles, and open when she is relaxed.
            </p>
         <p></p>
         
            <p >
                In order to be able to do this, we should measure the different potentials of the girl with an <b> electromyogram </b> and then program it into an Arduino.
            </p>
         <p></p>

               <font size="5," color="#a19a59"><b> Finally, lets talk about the electronic part: </b></font>
         <p></p>
            <p >
                This is the part that we would like to leave for the 
end, since is more a refinement part. We would have to do some basic 
circuitry with a motor, the electrodes and the amplifiers, but will look
 more into detail once we are in the lab.
