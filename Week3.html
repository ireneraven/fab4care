             <h2> EDITING THE BODIES OF THE 3D SCANNING </h2>
             
              <h3>MESHMIXER </h3> 
              <p>
              Meshmixer is used, among other things, to clean up a 3D scan. 
              <p></p>
              The last week, we scanned our own body, scans which would be clean up by this software this week.
              <p></p>
              Firstly, it is neccesary to import the scan you want to modify. In my case, I choosed the arm. Always, it is very useful for delate all the details you don't want in your scan, to press "select", select everything you would like to clean up, and press "edit". For ending, the option "Discard" should be pressed. (It is also possible just to select what you want to delate, and press the letter "X" on the keyboard).
              
              </p>
            </div>

            <img src="week3/Image1.JPG"width="400" height="450"> 
            
            -->  <img src="week3/Image2.JPG"width="500" height="300" >
            <p></p>
        

            If it is desired to change the position of the object, the botton edit should be pressed, follow by the botton "transform".
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image3.JPG" width="400" height="300">
            <p></p>
            Another useful tool are the brushes which can be found pressing "sculpt". They are used to modify the 3D scan, improving the figure the way you want.
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image4.JPG" width="400" height="350">
            <p></p>
            
            As it can be apreciated, a wide variety of tools can be used. To finish, just mention that to close the figure completely, the option of "make solid" within "Edit" exists.
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image5.JPG" width="400" height="450">
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            
            Once all these steps are completed, the object has too be exported since now we are going to use the software Autodesk Fusion 360. This software was explain in the Week1.
            <p></p>
            <h3>AUTODESK </h3> 
            <p></p>
            To start with, it is necessary to positionate in a properly plane the object, to make easier all the following process.
            The goal is to make a mold of our scan. 
            <p></p>
            Since the object is uploaded up to Autodesk, the sculpt mode will be the one that is worked on.
            <p></p>
            Firstly, a cylinder must be design around the object. For that, it is necessary to prss "Create""-->"Cylinder".
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image7.JPG" width="400" height="450">
            <p></p>
            
            After this, the cylinder should be modify getting closer to the original object, making the desired mold. This can be done pressing "Edit form" withing "Modify".  
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image8.JPG" width="600" height="350">
            <p></p>
            
            Once we have the mold, we hide the arm, and we just work with the mold. To continue, the mode has to be changed to "Model". Subsequently, within "Sketch"-->"Spline"-->"Fit point spline"  creating we create a separatory line in the midle of our mold and pressing "modify" --> "Split body" we devide our figure in two different bodies.
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image9.JPG" width="600" height="350">
            <p></p>
            The last step in this program is to export the two bodies to Exact Flat. For that. firstly it's necessary to create the pieces as shown in the picture below. After this, we just have to upload them to the new program. 
             <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image10.JPG" width="600" height="350">
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>EXACT FLAT</h3> 
            <p></p> 
            <h2>Exact flat is the leader program in 3D to 2D digital pattering.</h2>
            <p></p>
            Fristly, in "Prepare", we have to press in "Adaptive Remesher" of "Remesher".This should be done with the standard mode. 
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image11.JPG" width="600" height="350">
            <p></p>
            Later, we shoul go to "Flatten", and press "Pre-Flatten" --> "Fracture".
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image12.JPG" width="600" height="350">
            <p></p>
            Once we have done these steps, it is necessary to choose the lines we consider appropriate to improve the 2D figure as much as possible. The goal is to eliminate any spikes that appear. When the image is clean, the option "Finish" should be pressed. Below is a picture of the final result.
            <p></p>
            <img src="week3/Image13.JPG" width="600" height="350">
            <p></p>
            Finally, to be able to print it, it has been downloaded as DXF.
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
